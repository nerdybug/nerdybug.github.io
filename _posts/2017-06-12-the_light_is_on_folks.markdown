Code is something I had never thought about before a year and a half ago. Not only had I never thought about it but I definitely never thought I'd be able to read and write it.

Well, I used some incredibly basic html in online journal posts <i>many</i> moons ago, but at the time I didn't think anything of the weird punctuation required to imbed a picture.

My early-college self didn't connect the dots of what I was doing to writing in another language. My early-college self only thought about writing in the sense of the english language, creatively stringing sentences together and composing work that wasn't riddled with mistakes. Well, here I am, learning how languages interact to show these very words on your screen, dear reader.

The job I was in when I joined this program was a job that I hated. I'd been doing the same thing for three years and I didn't enjoy any part of it, yet I kept going. Talking to strangers all day on the phone about death was weighing me down intensely.

About a year and a half ago, I met a software developer who is now very dear to my heart. This person opened my mind to code, particularly the aspect of code being a language with syntax galore. The part of my brain covered in cobwebs collecting dust from years of not writing creatively perked up so I made an account on codecademy.

I was nervous and intimidated at first, self-doubt ready to strike at the first head-scratch. To my surprise, I was passing tests and understanding concepts and feeling proud. But with the crushing nature of my 8-5 work, I found it near impossible to muster the mental focus to learn something new in my off-time. This caused the lessons to become few and far between. It got harder to retain what I'd learned as more time passed between each lesson. I knew that if this was something I really wanted to learn, I needed to devote more constant attention and time to it. 

The more I thought about it, the more I realized that my mind was aching to be challenged. The work I was doing was not technically hard (emotionally hard, yes) but I didn't have to figure tough problems out. That lack of challenge responded to the new challenges faced in codecademy lessons that didn't pass on the first go. I got so frustrated with how I felt that I knew it was time to change something, time to put up or shut up, time to really buckle down and get my learn on.

My life now is spent less at work (thank you, part-time hours) and more on learning to code. None of it would be possible if that one person hadn't entered my life and stuck around. Without the heart-felt encouragement and literal support, I wouldn't be right here.

It's like a light switched on in a dark corner of my mind and now that I can clearly see that corner, I can't ignore it. Maybe one day, wrinkly and hunched from years of looking down at a cell phone, I would have realized "I should've learned to code" but I've always thought that some things happen for a reason and I'm grateful beyond words to be here.

Let the code-ventures begin!
