*the bookshelf experience*

For this project, writing tests was not required. I decided to require it myself. Testing is my favorite aspect of this whole web developer thing and I wanted to give myself a challenge in writing tests for this simple book inventory site.

When I began this web dev journey, the *language* aspect of code is what fascinated me as someone with a background in writing. Spending time pouring over each line looking for what was missing or out of place intrigued me. What some would call tedious, I would call fun. 

Applying my love of hunting misspelled words to writing code just made sense. In this line of thinking, tests are a framework for tracking those mistakes down, finding bits and pieces that hinder comprehension. So, I started thinking about what ideas my project needed to get across, what would my user be doing. I created some bare bones tests with those ideas in mind and began fleshing the rest of the code out. Lots of trial and error but that's the whole point of tests. I went back to add more tests once more features were written. Seeing tests pass is almost as fun as when they fail. Ooo the F word; failing in this line of work is not so much a real fail as it is an opportunity to learn.

When I sat down to think about what I wanted this blog post to be, a poem came out of my pen (yes, I wrote my ideas down with a pen on paper). I'll spare you, dear reader, but the message was that my somewhat dormant passion for writing led me here to learning to be a developer and I shouldn't forget that. 

My advice to anyone reading this who may be in or close to my shoes, remember what brought you here in the first place and never forget that. Also, write tests!
