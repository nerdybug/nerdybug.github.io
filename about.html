<p>An out-of-practice writer has gone part-time at her job in the insurance world to learn how to write in new languages. Instead of writing poems like she did in high school, she's writing programs. The challenge is real, some days more than others, but she is loving every new set of problems. None of this would be possible without a very special someone's encouragement and support; the author is grateful beyond words to be on this journey. Let the code-ventures begin! </p>
